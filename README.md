This project was bootstrapped with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Replace the "[CLIENT-KEY-HERE]" in src/components/Persona.jsx with your client key from the Persona Webapp.

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view the application in your browser.
